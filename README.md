# Capstone_Strawberry_Detect

Monitoring Interface:




This is the final year capstone project

Leveraged a YOLOv8 deep learning model to differentiate between healthy / moldy strawberry; training on a dataset of 3225 annotated images to ensure high precision and recall across multiple classes; the system automatically initiates real-time irrigation based on health detection via COM serial communication to Raspberry Pi 
Implemented a high-performance real-time video processing system for strawberry detection, utilizing OpenCV and Python; Ensuring optimal crop conditions by continuously updating and displaying the latest data and status through a video monitoring interface; Optimized video stream bandwidth through advanced data compression techniques and established robust API endpoints with Flask for efficient data handling.
Developed a responsive front-end interface, integrating WebSocket communication to ensure seamless real-time data transfer between the backend and frontend, facilitating immediate updates and interactive user engagement.
