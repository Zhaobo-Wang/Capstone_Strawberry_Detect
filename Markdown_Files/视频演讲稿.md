For real time video, we capture frame by frame and doing image processing by each frame using our model

Using opencv library to draw and label the height and width of our objects

Using socket return our results from backend to frontend and show the results in front end as a real time data results

Convert each frame to jpeg format in video stream and send the after processing video to frontend

And also fetch some weather API as parts of monitoring 

Backend of the web using Python Flask/ Frontend of the web using html/javascript/css

Netron Website show our model 



Convolutional Netural Network based on several different layers, first layer to do a convolution in order to get the Edge detection, using a soft kernel can reduce image noise and doing a max pooling layer can reduce some unimportant dataset, and doing serveal layers in order to detect strawberry more precisely
